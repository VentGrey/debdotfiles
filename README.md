# debdotfiles - Personal Debian/Devuan/Red Hat dotfiles/programs.

This repository is my "main" repository for the software I use everyday. However, as I completely ignored the UNIX principles in this repository, you can find configuration files, programs authored by other humans that I've decided to include here with proper attribution(WIP).

Things you can find here:

- My collection of Ansible playbooks (Curating more playbooks)
- `.desktop` files to autostart in XDG Autostart specification compliant Xorg WMs/DEs
- A collection of various programs, some authored by me, some authored by other people:
  - Author: Someone
  - **credits list is WIP**
- A patched version of dmenu 5.0, I don't remember wtf did I patch there but it works fine.
- `etc` configurations that I use on some systems.
- A copy of a lemonbar fork with XFT support and wide unicode support for newer nerd fonts
- mpv configurations to "mimic" VLC functions I miss. I cannot tolerate QT tho...
- a .gitconfig template for a more...private configuration
- Unimportant gtk2 config
- Installed cargo packages
- Favourite devuan packages
- Neovim config
- Python 3 installed packages
